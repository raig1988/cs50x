Pyramid build a la Mario
It has to be a positive integer between 1 and 8 inclusive
User can input any height to build pyramid
Running program:
$ ./mario
Height:
If user sets an incorrect number, program should ask again

Prompt for input
get_int to ask for an int as an input
add aditional logic to be between 1 and 8
using a loop may help to ask again the user
While loops
while (condition)
{
    // something happens
}
do while loops (this allows us to ask again and again)
do
{
    // something happens
}
while (condition);
boolean expression (condition)
x  > 0 && x < 10

    int height, row, column, space;
    do
    {
        height = get_int("Height: ");
    }
    while (height < 1 || height > 8);

    for (row = 0; row < height; row++)
    {
        for (space = 0; space < height - row - 1; space++)
        {
            printf(" ");
        }
        for (column = 0; column <= row; column++)
        {
            printf("#");
        }
        // lines
        printf("\n");
            }
